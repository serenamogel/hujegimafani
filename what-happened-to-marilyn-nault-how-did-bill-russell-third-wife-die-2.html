His second wife was Dorothy. She was Miss USA in 1968.

Considering his groundbreaking performance in the NBA, he was hired as a coach for the Boston Celtics from 1966 to 1969.</p><p>Bill’s fortune has now been transferred to his three children; his first marriage resulted in the birth of all three children.</p><p>During their marriage, the couple lived a very happy and luxurious life.
