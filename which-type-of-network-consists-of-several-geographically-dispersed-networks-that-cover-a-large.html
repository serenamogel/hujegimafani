Explanation: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a collection of geographically dispersed networks.<h2>Which of the following is a LAN device?</h2>A router is a device that connects a local area network (LAN) to the Internet (WAN).<h2>What is WAN device?</h2>A wide area network (WAN) is a geographically distributed private telecommunications network that interconnects multiple local area networks (LANs). A LAN is a group of computers and network devices which are all connected to each other, typically from within a short relative geographical distance.<h2>What connects LAN and WAN?</h2>Router. A router is a network device that connects together two or more networks. A common use of a router is to join a home or business network (LAN) to the Internet (WAN).<h2>Network Types: LAN, WAN, PAN, CAN, MAN, SAN, WLAN</h2><p></p><h2>What is LAN MAN and WAN network?</h2>LAN stands for Local Area Network. MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network. WAN stands for Wide Area Network.<h2>What is the difference between LAN & WAN?</h2>Difference between a LAN and WAN (WAN vs LAN)<p>The full form of LAN is 'Local Area Network'. WAN stands for 'Wide Area Network'. Covers a small and limited area, such as home, school, office. Covers a large geographical area, such as cities or nations.</p><h2>What is difference between intranet and extranet?</h2>Intranet and Extranet: What is the Difference?

Report Error Is there an error in this question or solution? Chapter 9: Introduction to Internet and Email - Evaluation - PART – II [Page 217]<h2>What is WAN port and LAN port?</h2>WAN, which is usually labeled either “internet” or WAN, will, in all environments, connect to a cable or DSL modem which then connects to the internet. LAN ports, on the other hand, connect computers using Ethernet cables, allowing them to access the internet alongside other devices using Wi-Fi.<h2>What is WAN LAN and PAN?</h2>These networks are broken down into several categories that explain where one device is in relation to another: PAN: Personal Area Network. LAN: Local Area Network. MAN: Metropolitan Area Network. WAN: Wide Area Network.<h2>What is meant by LAN?</h2>A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a common communications line or wireless link to a server within a distinct geographic area.<h2>What is the difference between PAN and LAN?</h2>Conceptually, the difference between a PAN and a wireless LAN is that the former tends to be centered around one person while the latter is a local area network (LAN) that is connected without wires and serving multiple users.<h2>What is the difference between a hub and a switch?</h2>Hub and Switch are the network connecting devices, both help to connect various devices. Hub works at the physical layer and transmits the signal to the port. Switch route the information and send it over the network.<h2>What is WAN network with example?</h2>Wide Area Network examples<p>The best example of a Wide Area Network is th Internet itself. Other smaller examples of WANs are: A network of bank cash dispensers; A Company network with several branch offices geographically distant.</p><h2>What is the Wi-Fi?</h2>Wi-Fi is the wireless technology used to connect computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices to the internet. Wi-Fi is the radio signal sent from a wireless router to a nearby device, which translates the signal into data you can see and use.<h2>What is network VPLS?</h2>The virtual private LAN service (VPLS) is an Ethernet-based point-to-multipoint Layer 2 virtual private network (VPN) that enables you to connect geographically dispersed Ethernet local area network (LAN) sites to each other across an MPLS backbone.<h2>What is PAN system?</h2>The PAN system of identification is a computer-based system that assigns unique identification number to every Indian tax paying entity. Through this method, all tax-related information for a person is recorded against a single PAN number which acts as the primary key for storage of information.<h2>What does Bluetooth PAN mean?</h2>In the PAN, the internet connection of one of the devices can be shared with the other device through Bluetooth tethering. Using this Bluetooth technology, you can pair a payment terminal with an Android or iOS tablet or smartphone that functions as a mobile cash register.<h2>How do I setup my tp link router without Ethernet cable?</h2><p>Power on your router and computer first and then modem.</p><li>Log into the router's web-based management page. ...</li><li>Configure WAN Connection Type. ...</li><li>Enter your PPPoE username and password which are provided by your ISP.</li><li>Click Save to save your settings, then the router will connect to Internet after a while.</li><h2>What is LAN and WAN Quora?</h2>• A Local Area Network (LAN) is a private computer network that connects computers in small physical areas. Example: A small office, A Single building, Multiple buildings inside a campus etc. Wide Area Networks (WAN) is type of computer network to connect offices which are located in different geographical locations.<h2>What is WAN connection type?</h2>Wide Area Network (WAN) is a telecommunication network that is used to simply extend a LAN over a large geographical distance. Technically, two or more local area networks can be connected via WAN with different layer 3 devices like routers or firewalls.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahoJygXanGsbGMqJ1mppWpxLC%2BymaaqKajnsC1v4yonWarlauys63LZp6ep5enrrG0yJyYpaSpYrGqv8%2BeqaydlGK7psDWqKmkq12ptaLAjJymr52iYq5uuMCrnp4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-type-of-network-consists-of-several-geographically-dispersed-networks-that-cover-a-large.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./will-priscilla-presley-be-buried-at-graceland.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./will-priscilla-presley-be-buried-at-graceland.html>Will Priscilla Presley Be Buried at Graceland?
