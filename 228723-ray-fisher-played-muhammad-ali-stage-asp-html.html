Now, his relationship with WB is less than perfect.</p><p class=Zg>Born in September 1987, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3570321/bio>Ray Fisher</a> used to be mainly focused on his career as a stage actor before WB hired him in 2014 to portray Victor Stone (Cyborg) in different movies of the DC Extended Universe.</p><h3 class=dh><strong class=Xg>Fisher claims that Whedon was "abusive" on set.</strong></h3><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Ray Fisher on January 10, 2019 in Los Angeles, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>RAY FISHER'S EARLY CAREER</strong></p><p class=Zg>When Fisher was still in high school, he <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/entertainment/2017/07/ray-fisher-cyborg-justice-league-bio-family/>grew fond of acting</a> after an English teacher encouraged him to audition for a school musical in his sophomore year.</p><p class=Zg>After graduating, he took a year off and, after working odd jobs, he applied to the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York. During his time in the academy, he played different roles in the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey.</p><p class=Zg>One of the most important theater gigs of his early career came when he was 24 years old and portrayed Tom Robinson in Harper Lee's "To Kill A Mockingbird."</p><p class=Zg>In 2013, before making his debut on the big screen, Ray Fisher attracted a lot of attention when he starred in an off-Broadway production called "<a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/theater/reviews/fetch-clay-make-man-about-stepin-fetchit-and-muhammad-ali.html>Fetch Clay, Make Man</a>."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>RAY FISHER PLAYING MUHAMMAD ALI</strong></p><p class=Zg>Written by Will Power, the play was about Muhammad Ali's relationship with actor Stepin Fetchit. It ran at the New York Theater Workshop in September and October 2013, and Fisher received rave reviews for his portrayal of the late heavyweight champion boxer.</p><p class=Zg>In order to nail the portrayal, Fisher had to put on 20 pounds of muscle, and it paid off as the <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/theater/reviews/fetch-clay-make-man-about-stepin-fetchit-and-muhammad-ali.html>New York Times</a> praised not only his performance but his "smooth good looks" that justified Ali's claims that he was as pretty as a girl.</p><p class=Zg>One year later, Warner Brothers put him on board the DC Extended Universe. Initially, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/article/2014/10/21/ray-fisher-dc-cyborg-movie/>not even Fisher knew</a> what WB had prepared for him, but it was eventually revealed that they had a solo "Cyborg" movie planned for April 2020. More on that later.</p><p class=Zg>His first appearance as <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenanarchy.com/2017/11/interview-justice-leagues-ray-fisher-on-becoming-cyborg.html>Cyborg</a> was a cameo in "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" (starring <a class="zd d" href=#>Ben Affleck</a> and Henry Cavill) released in 2016. However, his most prominent presence in the DCEU came one year later in "Justice League."</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>RAY FISHER'S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST JOSS WHEDON</strong></p><p class=Zg>As we all know by now, the novel coronavirus shut down the production of several films and TV shows and even delayed the release date of finished projects. However, Ray Fisher's solo "Cyborg" film was not affected by the pandemic.</p><p class=Zg>In fact, it seems like <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenrant.com/cyborg-dceu-movie-release-today-not-happen-reason/>WB simply forgot</a> about it as it was the only film out of the ten announced in 2014 that never had a writer or director hired. To make matters worse, the relationship between Ray Fisher and WB has deteriorated.</p><p class=Zg>For months, the actor has been publicly alleging that director Joss Whedon and producers Geoff Johns and Jon Berg <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/justice-league-investigation-ray-fisher-1234741917/>mistreated him</a> while filming "Justice League."</p><p class=Zg>Fisher claims that Whedon was "abusive" on set and that Johns, former president of DC Entertainment, even threatened his career.</p><p class=Zg><strong class=Xg>RAY FISHER SLAMMING WARNER BROTHERS' INVESTIGATION</strong></p><p class=Zg>It is important to point out that Zack Snyder was the movie's original director, but had to leave the production for personal reasons. Whedon replaced him and ordered plenty of reshoots that made it into the final version.</p><p class=Zg>As <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/justice-league-investigation-ray-fisher-1234741917/>Variety</a> reported, WarnerMedia decided to launch an investigation following Fisher's allegations, but WB claims that Fisher has <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://screenrant.com/justice-league-reshoots-ray-fisher-wb-investigation-response/>refused to participate</a> in the interview. The actor, however, has been sharing his version of the situation on social media.</p><p class=Zg>Apart from pointing out that WB hired a firm that is not independent of them, he accused the investigator of not contacting critical witnesses to favor WB's "<a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/ray8fisher/status/1305523328459964419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1305523329479118848%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fscreenrant.com%2Fjustice-league-reshoots-ray-fisher-wb-investigation-response%2F">false narrative and scapegoating efforts</a>."</p><p class=Zg>Actors who worked with Whedon in "Justice League" have sided with Ray Fisher, including <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFIevynjCfZ/>Jason Momoa</a> (Arthur Curry/Aquaman) and <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFAs9pPp8_h/>Kiersey Clemons</a> (Iris West). Clemons' character was cut from Whedon's version of the film but is expected to appear in the Snyder Cut in 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtpcW9iaHqzrdhmnaKrmJq%2FbrzLmrCenF2iwqmtzKaYnWWRobZuv9Oanp5lkai9b7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f228723-ray-fisher-played-muhammad-ali-stage-asp-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-rooibos-tea.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-rooibos-tea.html>What Is Rooibos Tea and How Do You Pronounce It?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lil-uzi-vert-car-accident.html>Lil Uzi Vert Car Accident Was He Involved In A Crash?
