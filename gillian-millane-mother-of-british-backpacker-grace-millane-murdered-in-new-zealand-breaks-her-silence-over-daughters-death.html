I don’t care about his name, I don’t care about him,” she said.</p><p>Just a week before Grace was killed, Gillian underwent surgery for a breast cancer diagnosis.</p><p>In a double blow for the family, Grace’s father David Millane was diagnosed with cancer after spending almost three weeks in Auckland in December 2019 while attending the trial for his daughter’s killer.</p><p>“He was taken unwell while we were at the trial but we just put it down to stress and we thought he had an ulcer,” Gillian said.</p><p>Unfortunately, David was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/fT4hXn4_395Got8Fp71tklex_A8=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/YTRQS4KGEBFEXGWHGKI6RXOH74.jpg"><p>“That was another disastrous Christmas and New Year,” said Gillian.</p><p>After the cancer spread to his brain, <a href=#>David died in November 2020</a>.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“I was in such a dark, lonely place and I pushed everybody away...

You’re full of s***.”</p><p>For both sets of the offending, he received total sentence of 11 years’ imprisonment.
