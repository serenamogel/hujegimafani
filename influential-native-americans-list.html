He was also a massively powerful chief at the time, his authority extending over 30 tribes and some 15,000 Algonquian-speaking people of the coastal Virginia area. Powhatan had a mixed relationship with the newcomers, his early assistance giving way to open warfare as they battled for control over the territory, though their relations were largely peaceful by the time of his death in 1618.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tamanend</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As with Powhatan, little is known of Tamanend's life beyond his encounters with 17th century English settlers, specifically the 1682/3 Treaty of Shackamaxon allegedly forged between his Lenni-Lenape Native Americans and William Penn in modern-day Philadelphia. However, the wisdom and generosity showed by the "<a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hiddencityphila.org/2014/05/respectfully-remembering-the-affable-one/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Affable One" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Affable One</a>" endured for generations, with colonists celebrating him as the "Patron Saint of America" in the years around the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Revolutionary War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Revolutionary War</a>. The legendary chief also sparked the formation of numerous social groups in his honor, including the infamous "Tammany Hall" organization that dominated New York City politics for more than 150 years.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Joseph Brant</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Introduced to colonial culture at an early age, Joseph Brant fought for the British in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/french-and-indian-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="French and Indian War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">French and Indian War</a>, converted to Christianity and served as a missionary among the Iroquois people. But the warrior and scholar also known as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/mohawk-chief-joseph-brant-dies data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Thayendanegea class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Thayendanegea</a> remained fiercely loyal to his Mohawk roots, and he rallied four of the six Iroquois nations to the side of what he felt was the more protective British Empire in the American Revolution. Brant fought with distinction in several major skirmishes in the New York area, rising to the rank of captain, though he faced a continuous uphill battle in its aftermath as he sought to broker peace and prosperity for his people.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sequoyah</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A silversmith and artist who was also known as George Gist or Guess, Sequoyah made his greatest contribution to indigenous culture with his formation of the Cherokee syllabary. His work, reportedly fine-tuned over the course of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/sequoyah-and-creation-cherokee-syllabary/#:%7e:text=Working%20on%20his%20own%20over,a%20short%20period%20of%20time." data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="12 years" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">12 years</a>, produced a collection of 85 symbols to match the sounds of his traditional language. But it caught on at a greater speed after its formal adoption by the Cherokee Nation in 1825, thanks to the launch of the bilingual Cherokee Phoenix and Sequoyah's efforts to foster mass literacy. His syllabary remains in use today, while his name lives on through the ancient trees that tower over the Northwest.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tecumseh</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The son of a Shawnee chief, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/tecumseh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tecumseh class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Tecumseh</a> became one of the most revered leaders of his time through his unyielding resistance to American intrusion. The full scope of his powers was on display in the early 1800s when he teamed with his brother Tenskwatawa to found the Prophetstown settlement in Indiana Territory and rallied considerable support for a pan-Indian alliance. Although <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/william-henry-harrison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Henry Harrison" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Henry Harrison</a>'s forces destroyed Prophetstown and eventually killed Tecumseh, Harrison co-opted the chief's legacy for his run to the White House in 1840, while General <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/william-tecumseh-sherman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="William Tecumseh Sherman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> revived his namesake's memory with his own military successes during and after the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Civil War" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Civil War</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sacagawea</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A Lemhi Shoshone Native American who was abducted by an enemy tribe and found herself married to a French Canadian trapper, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/sacagawea data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Sacagawea class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sacagawea</a> stepped into the limelight when she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/how-sacagawea-helped-lewis-clark data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=joined class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">joined</a> the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/lewis-clark-corps-of-discovery-sacagawea data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lewis and Clark expedition" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Lewis and Clark expedition</a>, baby boy in tow, in April 1805. Along with serving as a translator for negotiations with the Shoshones, the teenage mother contributed to the mission's success with her knowledge of vegetation and geographical checkpoints, enduring illness and the elements until returning to her South Dakota home in August 1806. Sacagawea soon slipped back into the shadows and died less than a decade later, though another version holds that she rejoined her people and lived to be nearly 100 years old.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Red Cloud</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A prominent Oglala Lakota chief of the Great Plains region, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/red-cloud data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Red Cloud" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Red Cloud</a> honed his fighting chops through early skirmishes with the Pawnee and Crow tribes, before turning his focus to overreaching white settlers in the second half of the 19th century. He ignited what became known as Red Cloud's War, which included an overwhelming victory over American forces at the Fetterman Massacre of December 1866. However, Red Cloud largely abandoned the call to battle after signing the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie, even after the U.S. overran territorial boundaries the following decade, and he spent his remaining years pushing for gains through peaceful means.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sitting Bull</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/sitting-bull data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sitting Bull" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sitting Bull</a> fought alongside Red Cloud in the 1860s, he diverged from the former over his refusal to commit his Hunkpapa Lakotas to the terms of a treaty. As a result, he became a central figure in the Great Sioux War of 1876, his vision of a military triumph presaging the historic defeat of General <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/george-custer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George Custer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">George Custer</a> at the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/native-american-history/battle-of-the-little-bighorn data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Battle of the Little Bighorn" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Battle of the Little Bighorn</a>. After surrendering in 1881, Sitting Bull briefly leveraged his celebrity as a member of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/buffalo-bill-cody data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Buffalo Bill" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Buffalo Bill</a>'s Wild West Show, but he never fully overcame his renegade urges and was killed after resisting arrest at the Standing Rock Reservation in 1890.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Crazy Horse</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Often mentioned in the same breath as Red Cloud and Sitting Bull, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/crazy-horse data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Crazy Horse" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Crazy Horse</a> featured prominently at the Fetterman Massacre and led the charge at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. But the Oglala Lakota warrior stands on his own as a figure of mythical proportions, from his legendary fighting prowess to his refusal to be photographed during his lifetime. His own life was relatively short, as he was killed shortly after surrendering in 1877 for attempting to help his sick wife with her parents, but his outsized memory lives on through the ongoing construction of an enormous <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://crazyhorsememorial.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=monument class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">monument</a> in his honor in South Dakota.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Geronimo</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A shaman of the Chiricahua Apaches, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/geronimo data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Geronimo class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Geronimo</a> spent much of his life fighting off the Mexicans, Americans and competing tribes who sought control of modern-day Arizona and New Mexico. He was largely successful in those endeavors, his reputation bolstered by alleged <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.history.com/news/7-things-you-may-not-know-about-geronimo?li_source=LI&li_medium=m2m-rcw-history" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="mystical abilities" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">mystical abilities</a> to slow time and stop flying bullets. It took the efforts of 5,000 U.S. troops – one-quarter of the standing Army – and another 3,000 Mexicans to force Geronimo and his followers out of hiding in September 1886, making him the last Native American leader to surrender to the military.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Chief Joseph</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In contrast with contemporaries who became famous for defending their lands, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/chief-joseph data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Chief Joseph" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Chief Joseph</a> is remembered for a valiant effort to lead his Nez Perce Native Americans out of harm's way. The retreat came after years of resisting attempts to relocate to a small Idaho reservation, a deadly skirmish forcing his band of 700 people on the run from their Wallowa Valley home. They nearly made it to safety in Canada amid the pressure applied by 2,000 U.S. troops, until Joseph delivered a memorable speech of surrender in October 1877. Although the "Red Napoleon" earned the respect of American military leaders, his hope of being allowed to return to the Northwest never came to fruition.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Wilma Mankiller</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The narrative of the Native American quest for survival continues past the forced relocations and bloodshed of the 19th century, its latter chapters filled with stories like those of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/wilma-mankiller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wilma Mankiller" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wilma Mankiller</a>. Named the first female chief of the Cherokee Nation in 1985, Mankiller spearheaded an array of health and education initiatives and is credited with boosting tribal membership and revenues by nearly 200 percent during her 10 years in charge. She also helped establish the federal Office of Tribal Justice, authored two books and taught at Dartmouth College, her lifelong commitment to activism rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGifoqukpL%2B6ecKuo62topp8qrrFpayepqSerq15zZqroq6VYq6usdGimpqmo2K5qr%2FT</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2finfluential-native-americans-list.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lee-starkey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lee-starkey.html>Lee Starkey</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-highwaymen-netflix-closer-look-frank-hamer-manny-gault-men-took-down-bonnie-clyde-woody-harrelson-kevin-costner.html>Netflix 'The Highwaymen' tells the true story of the Texas Rangers who took down Bonnie and Clyde</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-highwaymen-netflix-closer-look-frank-hamer-manny-gault-men-took-down-bonnie-clyde-woody-harrelson-kevin-costner.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
