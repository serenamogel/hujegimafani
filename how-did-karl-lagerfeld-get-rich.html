His father’s company produced and imported evaporated milk, while his maternal grandfather was a local politician for the Catholic Centre Party. Lagerfeld’s family was part of the Old Catholic Church. His parents wedded in 1930, and he had an older half-sister, Theodora Dorothea, from his father’s first marriage, as well as an older sister, Martha Christiane.</p><p>Lagerfeld was known for his iconic style, including his signature white hair, black sunglasses, fingerless gloves, and high, starched, detachable collars. Despite his fashion-forward image, Lagerfeld was known to misrepresent his age and background. He claimed to be younger than his actual age and misrepresented his parents’ background. For example, he once claimed that he was born in 1938 to “Elisabeth of Germany” and Otto Ludwig Lagerfeldt from Sweden, both of which were later proven to be false. He insisted that no one knew his actual birth date and had misreported his age on various occasions.</p><p>Lagerfeld had an early interest in visual arts and was often caught drawing and sketching by his former schoolmates. In interviews, he attributed much of his early learning to visiting the Kunsthalle Hamburg museum, where he gained more experience than he did in school. He continued to pursue his passion for art and design throughout his life and was widely regarded as one of the most influential fashion designers of his time.</p><p>Despite his eccentricities, Karl Lagerfeld remains an icon in the world of fashion, and his contributions to the industry will continue to inspire generations of designers to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Karl Lagerfeld get rich?</h2><p>Karl Lagerfeld became wealthy through his successful career in the fashion industry.
