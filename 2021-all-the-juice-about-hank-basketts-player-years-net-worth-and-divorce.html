He also starred on the reality TV show, Kendra and Kendra on Top with his ex-wife, Kendra<p>Hank Baskett spent most of his time in the National Football League (NFL) with the Philadelphia Eagles. Baskett spent only four seasons in the NFL before he called it quits in 2011 after his contract with the Eagles ran down and he could not find another football franchise to sign him up – even after becoming an unrestricted free agent. It is safe to say that Hank Baskett did not have the most spectacular career in the NFL. Nonetheless, he is mostly known for his marriage to Kendra Wilkinson, the role he played on E! cable network, and WE TV’s reality television series – Kendra&nbsp;and&nbsp;Kendra on Top.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-career-rise></span><strong>Early Life and Career Rise&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Baskett achieved moderate celebrity status as an NFL player. Born Henry Randall Baskett III on September 4, 1982, in Clovis, New Mexico, he grew up knowing his parents have a common interest in the branch of the armed forces concerned with air combat. While his dad, Henry Randall Baskett worked for the Air Force before he started managing the activities of a social service program, it is known that his mum, Judy Baskett was a financial officer at an Air Force Base in Clovis.</p><p>The athlete began playing football at Clovis High School. He was also a letterman in basketball and track but football seemed to have his heart. Hank wasn’t one of those jocks who let their academic work suffer because of their interest in sports as he graduated from Clovis High with a 4.0 GPA.</p><p>Upon graduating from high school, Baskett attended the University of New Mexico where his stats proved him to be an NFL material. He was the varsity team’s leading receiver for the years 2004 and 2005.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-short-and-uneventful-years-in-the-nfl></span><strong>His Short and Uneventful Years in The NFL</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2006, he signed as a rookie undrafted free agent with the Minnesota Vikings, however, he played only in the offseason and was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Baskett quickly established himself at the Eagles, snapping the rookie of the week award after their match against the Atalanta Falcons. His starting annual salary with the side was $275,000 with an extra $20,000 signing bonus which he received till 2008 when he parted ways with the side. His annual salary rose to $360,000 in his sophomore season and $445,000 in his third and final season with the franchise. In total, Hank Baskett earned at least $1.14 million for his time with the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>He joined the Indianapolis Colts in September 2009 on a one-year contract. He played in the Super Bowl XLIV against NFC champs, New Orleans Saints. However, after his team lost the coveted title, Baskett was released. He walked away with a $700,000 base salary and a $100,000 bonus.</p><p>Hank Baskett returned to the Philadelphia Eagles on a one-year, $800,000 contract. After being released 6 months later, he re-signed with his first-team the Minnesota Vikings. He became an unrestricted free agent after the end of his contract in March 2011. With no further signings, Baskett hung his helmet in 2011, bringing his total NFL earnings to at least $2.75 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-other-sources-of-his-4-million-net-worth></span><strong>What Are The Other Sources Of His $4 Million Net Worth?&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Baskett enjoys a net worth estimated at $4 million. Since it is obvious he did not make all of it from the NFL – as he did not last very long there -it is clear he made his fortune via a number of businesses.</p><p>An ardent gamer, Baskett has an interest in the eSports business. The former NFL star believes eSports is on the verge of becoming a global phenomenon.</p><p>In 2014, he became a co-owner of&nbsp;GAEMS, a&nbsp;portable console/monitor system maker. He is also a minority owner of the eSports’ Team EnVyUS. Hanks who has his own Twitch channel&nbsp;became a co-owner of Denial eSport in March 2017. The financial terms of the deal were left concealed.</p><p>While Baskett was quite famous, his marriage to the former Playboy model,&nbsp;Kendra Wilkinson&nbsp;thrust him further into the limelight. Their hit reality shows Kendra&nbsp;and Kendra on Top have hugely contributed to his fortune.</p>HANK BASKETT’s CAREER EARNINGS<ul><li>INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (2009-10): $800,000</li><li>PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (2008-09): $450,400</li><li>PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (2007-08): $365,400</li><li>PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (2006-07): $275,000</li><li><strong>TOTAL EARNINGS: $1,890,800</strong></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=explaining-the-married-life-and-divorce-of-hank-baskett></span><strong>Explaining The Married Life and Divorce of Hank Baskett</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Baskett met Kendra in 2008, she was fresh off the Playboy Mansion where she served as one of Hugh Hefner‘s girlfriends. Their first meeting was on a golf course and it was clear to both of them that they were in love; Kendra felt immediately that he was her man while Baskett was convinced to go with his guts that she was the woman for him.</p><p>Although playing for the Philadelphia Eagles when they met, he still joined her to co-star in Kendra’s self-titled reality show which premiered on June 7, 2009, to record-breaking numbers.</p><p>The show became a money-making machine for both Kendra and Baskett. US Weekly reportedly paid $120,000 to publish their wedding photos. Kendra’s wedding accessories from dress to jewelry was valued at $100,000. The show ended in 2011 after they parted ways with the E! network.</p><p>The couple’s next show Kendra on Top premiered on WE tv on 5th June 2012. The show followed the couple’s relationship as well as their daily lives. Hank’s transition from NFL star to businessman was also chronicled on the show. Like the first show,&nbsp;Kendra on Top became another hit. Kendra reportedly made $2 million from the show in 2013. The curtains came down in May 2016, after 5 seasons and 76 episodes.</p><p>As of this writing, Hank and Kendra share two children together; son Henry Randall “Hank” Baskett IV (born on December 11, 2009) and daughter Alijah Mary Baskett (born on May 16, 2014).</p><p>When it first emerged in 2018 that the couple could be having some serious marital issues, the popular words on the streets was that Kendra was only faking the marital problems only to boost the ratings of the show – Kendra on Top. This forced her to come out and make a statement that their issues were not fake. Everything was real.</p><p>She also announced to her fans on social media that she was on her last day as Baskett’s wife. They had been separated since the start of 2018 and she filed for divorce a few months later, stating it was best for her, her husband, and the kids. The divorce was finalized in 2019.</p><p>Since the end of their relationship, Hank Baskett has managed to keep a low profile in his personal life. Hence, it is still not known if he has started another relationship yet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-sex-scandal-that-has-made-people-question-his-sexuality></span><strong>The Sex Scandal That Has Made People Question His Sexuality</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Baskett’s marriage to Kendra Wilkinson nearly hit the rocks in 2014 after an infidelity scandal. Baskett allegedly had an affair with a transgender model, Ava Sabrina London while Wilkinson was eight months pregnant with their second child. After the incident, Kendra threw her wedding ring in the toilet and threatened to file for a divorce.</p><p>However, the couple worked things out after Baskett came clean with his own side of the story which he told on an episode of the reality TV show Marriage Boot Camp (the story can be found here). However, this story is one of the main reasons people think Hank Baskett is gay.</p><p>At some point, his wife Kendra even came out publicly to state that he isn’t gay. She also expressed that she doesn’t believe he has a sexual desire for transsexuals.</p><table id=tablepress-684 class="tablepress tablepress-id-684"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Profile
