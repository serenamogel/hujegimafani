In a 2007 interview with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://people.com/celebrity/exclusive-interview-jennifer-aniston/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">People</a>, she explained, “It’s funny.

These treatments have helped her maintain a youthful appearance with flawless skin that shows no signs of aging. However, she hasn’t gone to extremes with these procedures, aiming to preserve her natural charm.</p><p>Dermatologists note that such interventions are common among older women, especially Hollywood stars who want to maintain a youthful and beautiful look.</p><p>There’s speculation that Jennifer Aniston may have had breast augmentation, as her breasts appear somewhat larger to some experts. When questioned about this, she firmly denied it, stating, “As boring as it sounds, it’s still mine, all of it. Still mine.”</p><p>She added, “I am not against it, but I am happy with what God made me like.” Some medical professionals believe that the perceived change in her breast size is due to exceptionally padded bras. Aniston attributes any difference to weight fluctuations, which is likely the case.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234 rel="noreferrer noopener">Becky Lynch Plastic Surgery: The Truth Behind Her Stunning ESPY Appearance</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Summary</h2><p>Jennifer Aniston, just like many other Hollywood stars, has undergone various beauty and facial treatments.
