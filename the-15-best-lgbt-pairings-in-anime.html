<time>13 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=516 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Anime genres like shounen, seinen, and shojo are often associated with action or romance, but even dedicated anime fans may not immediately connect them with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LGBT</a> </strong>pairings or couples. Despite the presence of numerous queer fictional characters across a wide range of shounen anime, these representations are often overlooked due to the prevailing conventionalism within Japanese society. As a result, readers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking LGBT content</a> often turn to dedicated literary genres such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yaoi</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuri</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shounen-ai</a>, and Shojou-ai.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=579 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>However, anime and manga enthusiasts might be pleasantly surprised to discover that many of their beloved characters <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">are actually queer</a>. In fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quite a few of these characters</a> share explicitly or implicitly portrayed relationships that go <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">beyond the bounds of a typical friendship</a>. While it’s true that the traditional nature of these stories means that many of these pairings aren’t fully canon within the narrative, one can still speculate about the author’s true intentions. With that in mind, let’s explore some of the best LGBTQ+ pairings in anime.</p><h2 id=h-michiru-haruka-and-zoisite-kunzite-sailor-moon data-injectable=false>Michiru & Haruka and Zoisite & Kunzite (Sailor Moon)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sailor-Moon.jpg><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>As a child watching <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sailor Moon</a>, it’s easy to overlook the presence of not just one, but two queer relationships within the story. Amidst all the action, I failed to notice these subtle nuances myself. The first couple, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune, also known as Michiru and Haruka, were in a romantic relationship right from the early stages of the series. Their connection was explicitly acknowledged by other characters, making them one of the earliest canon lesbian couples in Japanese media.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>The second queer couple in Sailor Moon consists of Zoisite and Kunzite. Although their relationship isn’t necessarily canon in the manga, the 1992 anime adaptation took it a step further. Whenever these two men appeared on screen, they were often depicted holding hands or standing side by side. While their relationship was never officially confirmed by the mangaka, there was enough evidence to regard them as a loyal and passionate duo in both the anime and manga versions.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ash and Eiji (Banana Fish)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Banana-Fish-Eiji-Ash.jpg><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=790 data-injectable=true>Ash and Eiji are a complicated duo to tread with. Often marketized as a Shojo, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Banana Fish</a> easily falls under the Seinen tag, due to its heavy and mature themes, most of which involve Ash and his understatedly difficult life. He is an openly bisexual character, who unexpectedly becomes attached to Eiji, a Japanese student researching street gangs in New York. Their friendship evolves into an ambiguous relationship, that is only physically evident through a very intentional kiss scene.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Often characterized by their soul bond connection, Ash and Eiji’s relationship shows love in a way that lovers only can experience, albeit their story is tragically cut short by the events in the anime. Still, Ash and Eiji are undeniably one of the best queer pairings in anime, for more reasons than I can name.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ymir and Historia (Attack on Titan)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ymir-Historia-Attack-On-Titan.jpg><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>Ymir and Historia form an intriguingly complex duo in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Attack on Titan</a>. Despite initially appearing as a potentially one-sided relationship, their bond and unwavering trust become evident to anyone who watches this groundbreaking shounen anime. Ymir’s deep affection for Christa is clear from the get-go, and even though Historia may not express her feelings in the same explicit manner, she still demonstrates her love in different, yet unmistakable ways.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Regrettably, their story does not have a happy ending. Nevertheless, the fact that a lesbian couple is prominently featured in one of the biggest anime series in the Western sphere already places Ymir and Historia among the most poignant and significant LGBT pairings in anime.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shion and Nezumi (No.6)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/no6-shion-nezumi.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">No.6</a> holds a special place in my heart as it was the very first anime I ever watched. I’ve revisited the series and delved into the manga, and for me, Shion and Nezumi undeniably deserve a spot among the best queer pairings. Their relationship is beautifully ambiguous, transcending the boundaries of friendship without crossing into full-blown romance (though there are occasional kisses).</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=833 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting that No.6 is often associated with Shounen-ai anime when in reality, it was meant to be an action story set in a post-apocalyptic universe, featuring a deep bond between two teenagers. While the nature of Shion and Nezumi’s relationship may be open to interpretation, their love for each other is unmistakably explicit, and because of this, they are one of the most beautifully portrayed pairings in anime.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Yukito and Touya (Cardcaptor Sakura)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cardcaptor-Sakura-Yukito-Touya.jpg><p data-characters=525 data-current-count=825 data-injectable=true>One of the earliest canon relationships in a shoujo anime, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardcaptor Sakura</a>, stands as a revolutionary example for its time, featuring a queer relationship that is openly displayed from the very beginning. Sakura’s brother, Touya, encounters Yukito on their first day of school, and from that moment onward, the pair becomes inseparable. Initially appearing as close friends, their relationship gains canonical status when Sakura confesses her feelings to Yukito, who, in turn, reveals his affection for someone else.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>It is during this revelation that Sakura realizes Yukito’s feelings for her older brother, Touya, and wholeheartedly supports their relationship. From then on out, it is believed that Touya and Yukito enter a romantic relationship, that had been well established from the get-go.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chisato and Takina (Lycoris Recoil)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lycoris-recoil-chisato-and-takina.png><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>After much deliberation, I couldn’t resist including Chisato and Takina in this list. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lycoris Recoil</a>, a seinen anime acclaimed for its stunning animation, prominently features the loyal friendship between Chisato and Takina. While romance is not a central focus of the anime, the relationship between Chisato and Takina <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">goes beyond the boundaries of mere friendship</a>, and it is evident throughout the series through their loving actions and skinship.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>Displaying a willingness to sacrifice their lives for each other on multiple occasions, this assassination duo repeatedly demonstrates their unwavering devotion. Despite starting off as strangers and initially lacking trust, the girls quickly develop a unique bond that surpasses traditional friendship norms. Their relationship beautifully exemplifies a deep and loving connection between two girls in anime.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Victor and Yuri (Yuri!!! On Ice)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Yuri-On-Ice.jpg><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuri!!! On Ice</a> undeniably became a cornerstone anime for BL and sports anime enthusiasts. This original story enthralled fans with its authentic portrayal of a vulnerable ice skater’s journey to reclaim his position at the top, guided by his newfound mentor, Victor. Beyond the bounds of a traditional mentor-student relationship, an unexpected on-screen kiss between the two characters solidified their growing connection.</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>As the episodes progressed, their relationship blossomed, culminating in a public declaration of love and the exchange of promise rings. This pivotal moment firmly established Victor and Yuri as one of the most beloved couples in anime, and by far, having one of the most emblematic moments in queer anime history.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Utena and Anthy (Revolutionary Girl Utena)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Revolutionary-Girl-Utena.jpg><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a> made a profound impact on the world of Shojo anime, presenting a story that combined magical elements with deep psychological themes. It also shattered the constraints of heteronormativity often prevalent in the genre. The two central characters, Utena and Anthy, initially start as friends but gradually develop a profound bond with one another.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>Their relationship unfolds within a non-discriminatory environment, adding to the list of older anime that feature a same-sex couple. By portraying the main characters in this Shojo series as queer, Revolutionary Girl Utena dismantles any lingering barriers, boldly challenging conventions and paving the way for greater LGBTQ+ representation.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Haruhi and Tamaki (Ouran High School Host Club)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ouran-High-School-Host-Club.jpg><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true>The question of whether Haruhi and Tamaki belong on a list of the best LGBTQ+ pairings has sparked endless debates among anime fans. It’s a tricky pick because, biologically, Haruhi is female. However, right from the first episode, the series makes it clear that gender identity and pronouns are at the bottom of Haruhi’s priority list. In fact, they often use the Japanese pronoun “ore,” typically used by guys to refer to themselves in informal situations.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>While some fans may deny Haruhi’s gender identity, it becomes pretty evident that Haruhi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is intended to be non-binary</a>. This, combined with Haruhi’s wholesome relationship with Tamaki, makes them one of the very few anime couples featuring a non-binary character in the medium. After all, if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouran High School Host Club</a> nailed something, it is their relationship.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jotaro and Kakyoin (Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jojos-Bizarre-Adventure.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">J</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ojo’s Bizarre Adventure</a> is understatedly one of the biggest queer-coded shounen out there. Flamboyant and exorbitant, this action story truly made its mark as one of the biggest anime out there. With its already established arsenal of queer characters – Dio, Squalo, and Tiziano – it’s no surprise that many fans believe there are more LGBTQ+ characters within its universe, as was the case with Jotato and Kakyoin.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>Despite not being a canon couple, these two characters have long been a fan favorite ship for some time, and when Akira, the author, confirmed that Jotaro wasn’t that interested in women, fans’ expectations went through the roof. Unfortunately, while their relationship will never see any fruits, they are still one of the best anime duos with queer undertones.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shuichi and Yoshino (Wandering Son)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Wandering-Son.jpg><p data-characters=485 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wandering Son</a> is one of the first – if not the first – anime to feature a relationship between two transgender teens. As most fans know, cross-dressing is a large part of Japanese culture, but in a glorious twist, this anime actually went beyond the common trope and finally addressed characters as being trans. Throughout the anime, we see Shuichi, a trans girl, struggling with gender identity and dysphoria, and like her, Yoshino, a trans boy, is going through the same issues.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Sadly, by the end of the story, the duo only end up as friends, despite oftentimes confessing their feelings, always at the wrong time. It’s a realistic and beautiful story, although these characters were not the endgame, they still make one of the best LGBTQ+ pairings in anime for their importance and overall fantastic story.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Sasaki and Miyano (Sasaki and Miyano)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sasaki-To-Miyano.jpg><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasaki to Miyano</a> has emerged as one of the recent notable couples in the shounen-ai anime realm, capturing the attention of numerous anime fans. This romance story has garnered praise for its utterly adorable plot and portrayal of loving relationships. What truly distinguishes Sasaki and Miyano from other couples in this genre is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their genuine connection and the depiction of a well-written shounen-ai manga</a>. The series beautifully represents a coming-of-age story that is flawlessly portrayed in the anime format, maintaining its essence to the core.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kase and Yamada (Kase-San and Morning Glories)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Kase-San-And-Morning-Glories.jpg><p data-characters=591 data-current-count=891 data-injectable=true>Though originating from an anime film, Kase and Yamada from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kase-San and Morning Glories</a> undeniably rank among the best LGBTQ+ pairings in the anime world. This yuri film beautifully captures the essence of a realistic and heartfelt first love, showcasing the enchantment that accompanies falling in love for the very first time. Despite being high school girls with starkly contrasting backgrounds, Yamada and Kase manage to transcend their differences and embark on a profoundly loving relationship that allows every fan to feel as if they’re falling in love for the very first time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ue and Mafuyu (Given)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Given-Ue-Mafuyu.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Given</a> has undoubtedly delivered one of the most beautiful and genuine LGBTQ+ relationships in anime. Among its array of queer couples, Mafuyu and Ue shine through with their unexpected connection forged by their shared love for music. Starting off as a seemingly comedic slice-of-life story, Given delves deeper into more tragic and intense plotlines, immersing fans in Mafuyu’s haunting past and Ue’s struggles with his own sexuality.</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>This semi-realistic portrayal of a relationship between two high school students has revolutionized the way male couples are depicted in the genre. With stunning animation and an even better narrative, Given has enthralled viewers with the heartwarming and entertaining bond between Mafuyu and Ue.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shion and Yayoi (Psycho Pass)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Psycho-Pass.jpg><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=false>As a seinen, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Psycho Pass</a>‘ mature themes include an unexpected romantic relationship that emerges between Shion and Yayoi. While the series may <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not primarily revolve around romance</a>, the undeniable physical and romantic connection between Shion and Yayoi becomes a significant aspect of their characters. What’s more, Shion is one of the few openly bisexual characters in anime and she has a past filled with relationships with both men and women. Their relationship adds complexity and depth to the story, further highlighting the diverse range of characters and experiences in Psycho Pass.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lYWp6o7HSrWSln5KperGtyKugp5%2BjYravecCnoKadXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-15-best-lgbt-pairings-in-anime.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./beth-littleford.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./beth-littleford.html>Beth Littleford</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./family-guy-season-20-episode-15-release-date-and-time-family-guy-season-20-episode-15-spoilers-countdown-when-is-it-coming-out-253316-html.html>Family Guy Season 20 Episode 15 Release Date and Time, Family Guy Season 20 Episode 15 Spoilers, Cou</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./family-guy-season-20-episode-15-release-date-and-time-family-guy-season-20-episode-15-spoilers-countdown-when-is-it-coming-out-253316-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
