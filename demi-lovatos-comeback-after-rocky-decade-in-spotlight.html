At this stage, she had also been diagnosed with bipolar.</p><p>Lovato further admitted to taking soda bottles filled vodka for early morning flights because she feared being sober on the plane.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>"I lived fast and I was going to die young â€¦ I didn't think I would make it to 21," she added to <i>American Way</i> in 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/dQEGMzTCivB16HKvYUJuCr1EGDE=/16x26/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LL6QVPF64Y6VDSUWSTFKNDYMGE.png"><p>In March 2012, MTV aired a documentary, <i>Demi Lovato: Stay Strong</i>, about her recovery, the star discussing her time in rehab and claiming she was sober at the time. Lovato later admitted to being under the influence of cocaine during that interview.</p><p>She stated: "I wasn't working my program. I wasn't ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew."</p><p>Not long after that, her management team threatened to leave her, forcing Lovato to start treatment again and get counselling for her addictions.</p><p>She moved into a sober-living facility in LA with roommates and responsibilities, and managed the incredible feat of staying sober for six years.</p><h2 class=article__heading>SUPERSTAR CAREER REVIVAL</h2><p>In May 2012, Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the US version of <i>The X Factor</i>, with a reported salary of $US1 million, and joining Britney Spears, Simon Cowell, and L.A.
