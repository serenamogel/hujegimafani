Kirk <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told Today’s Christian Woman</a> about their marriage, “God wants us to be, in our married lives, blueprints for people, especially young people … You can't take a blueprint and just throw it on the ground.
