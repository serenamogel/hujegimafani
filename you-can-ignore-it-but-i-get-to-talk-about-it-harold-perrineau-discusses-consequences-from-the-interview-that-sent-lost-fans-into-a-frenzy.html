The backlash was swift, and Perrineau recently explained just what that felt like. Spoiler: It felt bad.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>In a recent deep dive on the show in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanity Fair</a> — which is a great read all-around and worth checking out — Perrineau revealed how he gave the interview and how it “quoted him fairly and accurately.”</p><p>“She asked me something, and I said—I don’t remember exactly the quote, but I’m gonna give you a roundabout version of it. I said, ‘You know, for me, as a Black person, the idea that Walt winds up living with his grandmother and not living with his father, that feels like one of those clichés—Black kids who have been raised by their grandparents because neither of their parents are around for them. I would’ve liked to have seen something a little better happen, but that’s not the way it went down.’”</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>Now remember, this is 2008. Obama wasn’t even officially president yet. There was no Black Lives Matter movement, and gay people couldn’t get married. The country’s come a long way since then, but even in today’s climate, Perrineau’s comments would probably be similarly handled by the political right.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>That’s not all he said, though. In the same interview, he was asked if it bothered him that he didn’t get to reconnect with his son in the show. He didn’t hold back:</p><p>“… There are all these questions about how they respond to Black people on the show. Sayid gets to meet Nadia again, and Desmond and Penny hook up again, but a little Black boy and his father hooking up, that wasn’t interesting? Instead, Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into a really big, weird stereotype and, being a Black person myself, that wasn’t so interesting.”</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>His take was not only derided by fans of the show but by its producers as well. He was accused of playing the “race card,” and he felt like he was being asked to suppress his own feelings to save other people’s discomfort. That, he said, did not feel good.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>The issue for Perrineau was clear: “I get to talk about being Black, you know? ’Cause I am Black. You can ignore it. But I get to talk about it.” The network tried to douse the flames by saying he was just mad he was leaving the show.</p><p data-characters=90 data-current-count=90 data-injectable=false>“I’m not angry that I left the show. Like, that’s what I think as a&nbsp;fan.”</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>Even worse, he was asked to apologize.</p><p>“Me mentioning the color of my skin—that just sent everybody off the rails. We came up with something, but it took weeks, because I was like, ‘I didn’t say anything wrong. And she didn’t report anything wrong. Nobody did anything wrong.’ But societally—people so loved the show. They couldn’t hear one thing against it.”</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>By pushing back against producers on the show, Perrineau found out the hard way what happens when you go against the almighty showrunners in Hollywood. Sounds brutal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y6u9RmmpqmXZ60r7vRnmSirF2XwrV5yGaenqxdqbxuwMClomaZkqTCtXnIrWShmaKkuaV5z56pq6Gemq62ecOiqpyto6iytHnCqKWsnaGqsq%2BvxKxkn6qfonq1tMRmoKeslafDqrHWZquhmaRiwKa602ajqKukYrOiutJmoKesn2KubrLRnqWzsV8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyou-can-ignore-it-but-i-get-to-talk-about-it-harold-perrineau-discusses-consequences-from-the-interview-that-sent-lost-fans-into-a-frenzy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bahia-watson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bahia-watson.html>Bahia Watson is an actress who is known for her work in The Handmaid's Tale, Saving Hope, etc among</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./valene-kane-net-worth-80831.html>Valene Kane Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./valene-kane-net-worth-80831.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
