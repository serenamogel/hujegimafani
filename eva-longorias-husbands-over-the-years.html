<time>11 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Inside actress Eva Longoria's many marriages: The 'Young and Restless' actress is a mother to one! &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Eva Longoria</strong>'s multi-faceted career has been a giant force in Hollywood. From foraying into the intimidating acting world with no connection in the 90s to anchoring a career as a director, and producer, Eva has come a long way. Born on March 15, 1975, in Corpus Christi, Texas, Eva has Mexican roots. &nbsp;</p><p>Longoria's stellar career has, in fact, been a monumental establishment for aspiring Latinos actors in Hollywood. She landed her big break, playing Gabrielle Solis in ABC's successful series, <i>Desperate Housewives</i>, in 2004. The actress's prolific resume also includes roles in <i>The Young and the Restless</i>,<i> Frontera,</i> and <i>Lowriders. &nbsp;</i></p><h3>The Truth About Eva Longoria's Failed Marriages! &nbsp;</h3><p>In search of fame and fortune, Eva met and fell in love with a number of men; some of those romances were well publicized, while a few ran under the radar. The Golden Globe-winning actress has been married three times and divorced twice. Eva was in her mid-20s when she got hitched to actor <strong>Tyler Christopher, </strong>in 2002. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/20/341922872_219705150748210_1402071738166719116_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687279250899.jpg><p>Longoria's nuptial with the fellow soap opera star, best known for his roles in <i>General Hospital</i>, and <i>Days of Our Lives</i>, seemed perfect on the surface, with the pair following similar career trajectories, and keeping it low at all times. But the marriage lasted less than two years as they called it quits in 2004. &nbsp;</p><p>The<i> Desperate Housewives </i>actress later cited her age and shortcomings as a wife for the failure of their marriage. "He was a lovely man, but I was very young," the actress explained, <a href=#>adding, </a>"I didn't know who I was, and I was still struggling as an actor. I was a terrible wife." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Christopher went on to marry his second wife,<strong> Brienne Pedigo</strong>, in 2008, and as for Longoria, she found love again with <strong>Tony Parker</strong>, a former basketball player. The actress and Parker started dating almost immediately after Longoria split ways with Tyler. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/20/326194412_2182648925275964_5116661574509684378_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687279257075.jpg><p>The love birds enjoyed a two-year-long dating bliss before announcing their engagement in November 2006 and getting married almost a year later in July 2007. Longoria's second divorce was a bitter experience for the actress as it ended because of Parker's infidelity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The couple- once loved for being the biggest cheerleaders of each other, were over by the year 2010. While the initial reason was cited as "irreconcilable differences," it was later revealed that the soap opera actress had discovered hundreds of messages from a woman on Parker's phone. &nbsp;</p><p>The shocking cheating scandal also unveiled Parker's mistress. The other woman was said to be Parker's then-fellow teammate<strong>, Brent Barry'</strong>s wife, <strong>Erin Barry</strong>. Longoria admitted to struggling with her self-esteem amid the cheating scandal. And Parker, on his part, also expressed remorse over their failed marriage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/20/327967577_566746292042712_5309835179883424456_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687279278682.jpg><p>But having faced two failed nuptials and a few unnoticed relationships, the <i>Desperate Housewives</i> actress doesn't look on the experience with regret. Longoria believes that all those relationships came into her life for all the right reasons. "I think every relationship is a path to where you are today," <a href=#>said</a> the optimistic actress. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Eva Longoria's Third Marriage! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>It took Longoria some alone time to finally find the love of her life. The Frontera actress was single for two years when she met, Mexican businessman <strong>José "Pepe" Bastón,</strong> in 2013. Both Eva and José were still dealing with the hurt of their previous relationship when they crossed paths for the first time, in early 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/20/312488643_107102572142253_3530375661112761936_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687279284152.jpg><p>But a meet-cute after six months of their first encounter sealed the deal for both. The Golden Globe winner gushed about her romance with the businessman, saying, "He is probably one of the first men I've dated that has been older and established and, basically, a grown-up." &nbsp;</p><p>The twosome went from being unsure, love-struck, smitten, and head over heels, all in the span of one year. "He's been sweeping her off her feet and courting her like a proper gentleman," an insider said as the duo seemingly went deeper in late 2013. The pair got engaged in December 2015. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eva shares a son with Bastón and is also a stepmom to his three kids from his previous relationship!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The soap opera star took to her Instagram to flaunt her ruby and diamond ring and revealed that the businessman proposed during their romantic getaway to Dubai. Less than a year into being engaged, the love birds tied the knot in Valle de Bravo, Mexico, on May 21, 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo's wedding was an intimate yet gorgeous affair, with the television actress donning a wedding dress designed by her friend, and bridesmaid, <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong>. Eva's nuptial, so far, has proved that the third time is indeed the charm. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/20/279963104_420480856107388_797470311019684283_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687279290913.jpg><p>The duo welcomed their firstborn, Bastón's fourth, son<strong> Santiago Enrique</strong>, on June 19, 2018. A source later shared how the actress opened up to the idea of becoming a mother after experiencing motherhood with her husband's three kids from his previous relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>"She loves his kids and now they're really excited to be expanding the family," the source explained. The veteran actress has since been documenting her blissful family life on Instagram. Eva recently commemorated her son's 5th birthday with a sweet clip of Santiago living his best life. "I didn't know this amount of love could exist," <a href=#>Eva wrote </a>in the heartfelt caption. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6tmmWcpLuou9GimKxlmKrAo63Nnapmp6aav27Ax55ksp2Rp8A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feva-longorias-husbands-over-the-years.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jessica-jacobs-net-worth-155639.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jessica-jacobs-net-worth-155639.html>Jessica Jacobs Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./nicole-moreiraaa-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-32033-html.html>Nicole Moreiraaa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./nicole-moreiraaa-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-32033-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
