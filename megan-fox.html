The actress enjoyed a career breakout opposite&nbsp;Shia LaBeouf in the blockbuster Transformers, and she went on to prominent roles in films like Jennifer's Body, Jonah Hex, This Is 40 and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. She has three children with actor Brian Austin Green.</p><h2 id=early-life>Early Life&nbsp;</h2><p>Fox was born on May 16, 1986, in Memphis, Tennessee. At the age of 5, she began taking singing and dancing lessons, which continued when she moved with her family to St. Petersburg, Florida, at age 10. At 13, she added modeling classes to her repertoire.</p><p>In 1999, Fox won multiple awards at the American Modeling and Talent Convention. This success convinced her to drop out of high school and move to Los Angeles just a few years later, at the age of 16.</p><h2 id=film-and-tv-roles>Film and TV Roles</h2><h3 id=holiday-in-the-sun-what-i-like-about-you>'Holiday in the Sun,' 'What I Like About You'</h3><p>That year, Fox landed her first big break when she was cast as a bratty heiress in the 2001 <a href=#>Ashley</a> and <a href=#>Mary-Kate Olsen</a> comedy, Holiday in the Sun. The film, which had a large cult fanbase, went straight to DVD. Over the next few years, Fox continued to appear in guest-spot television roles. Her next role was in 2002, when she appeared in the Swedish-produced soap opera&nbsp;Ocean Ave. That same year, Fox enjoyed a guest-starring role on the WB network show What I Like About You, starring <a href=#>Amanda Bynes</a>.</p><h3 id=hope-faith-confessions-of-a-teenage-drama-queen>'Hope & Faith,' 'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen'</h3><p>The year 2004 was a big one for Fox. She made an appearance in the CBS hit comedy Two and a Half Men, starring <a href=#>Charlie Sheen</a> and Jon Cryer, and was a series regular on the short-lived WB sitcom, The Help. She also began appearing on the ABC sitcom Hope & Faith, in which she played the daughter of Faith Ford's character in the second and third seasons. Her performance earned her a Young Artists Award nomination in 2005. Fox also returned to film work that year when she won the role of Carla Santi, a rival of <a href=#>Lindsay Lohan's</a> character, in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.</p><h3 id=transformers-and-sequel>'Transformers' and Sequel</h3><p>Fox landed her biggest break in 2007 when she was cast alongside Shia LaBeouf in the <a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a>-produced blockbuster Transformers. Fox played romantic lead Mikaela Banes in the film, earning an MTV Movie Award nomination for breakthrough performance.&nbsp;</p><p>With her stunning looks, Fox regularly graced the pages of men's magazines like Maxim during this time, earning FHM's designation of "Sexiest Woman Alive" in 2008. She also drew attention for her talent and marketability, topping Moviefone's list of "The 25 Hottest Actors Under 25" in 2008.</p><p>That year, Fox joined the cast of the comedy How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, which performed well in the U.K. but didn't achieve much commercial success in the U.S. In 2009, Fox reprised her role as Mikaela Banes in Transformers: Rise of the Fallen. The sequel was again a box office success and kept Fox in the media spotlight. She signed on for the third installment of the franchise but later left the project, reportedly due to her disagreements with director Michael Bay.</p><h3 id=jennifer-s-body-jonah-hex-tmnt>'Jennifer's Body,' 'Jonah Hex,' 'TMNT'</h3><p>In 2009, Fox appeared in the horror film Jennifer's Body, which opened to minor success. She went on to play Leila, the gun-toting mistress, in the Wild West film Jonah Hex (2010), and enjoyed a supporting part in Judd Apatow's&nbsp;This Is 40 (2012). Fox then took on the role of April O'Neil, friend of the titular terrapins in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;(2014) and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016).</p><h3 id=new-girl-zeroville>'New Girl,' 'Zeroville'</h3><p>Away from the big screen, Fox landed the recurring role of Reagan Lucas on season 5 of the popular comedy New Girl, which began in 2016. In late 2018, she hosted the four-part Travel Channel docu-series Legends of the Lost with Megan Fox, which explored the historical value of mythological people and events like the Amazons and the&nbsp;Trojan War.&nbsp;The following year, the actress returned to feature film work with Above the Shadows,&nbsp;Zeroville&nbsp;and The Battle of Jangsari.</p><h2 id=personal-life>Personal Life</h2><p>In June 2010, Fox became engaged to actor Brian Austin Green of Beverly Hills, 90210 fame. The couple had been engaged previously, following a two-year relationship, but canceled their wedding in 2009. Shortly after their second engagement, Fox made headlines when she lost her two-carat diamond ring on a beach while vacationing with Green in Hawaii. It was later revealed that the couple exchanged vows while they were in Hawaii.</p><p>The couple has three sons, Noah (b. 2012), Bodhi (b. 2014), and Journey (b. 2016).</p><p>In August 2015, Green and Fox announced their separation after 11 years together, before reconciling in 2016. In May 2020, it was reported that the couple had separated again. Fox began a relationship with rapper Machine Gun Kelly soon thereafter. The couple announced their engagement in January 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp3yuscaapWaen60%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmegan-fox.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-does-kirk-herbstreit-travel-with-his-dog-who-is-kirk-herbstreit-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-does-kirk-herbstreit-travel-with-his-dog-who-is-kirk-herbstreit-html.html>Why does Kirk Herbstreit Travel with his Dog?
