She was also reported to appear in two additional movies Dirty South House Arrest and The Hills. In spring of 2017, LaTavia confirmed she is set to release her autobiography, which she described as a memoir to her fans entitled 'I Am LaTavia'. She engaged in a feud with People Magazine after alleging they misquoted and misrepresented her interview online. Roberson released her first song as a solo artist, which is an EDM track entitled "Best Time of Your Life" on June 23, 2017.</p><p>In 2016, Roberson started an online YouTube-based series called 'The Online Diary of LaTavia Roberson.'</p><p>In 2013, LaTavia starred in J.F. Bailey's stage plays How to Love and Not My Family. On August 21, 2013, LaTavia gave birth to her first child, a girl named Lyric Richard, with record producer Don Vito. In 2014, LaTavia was added to the main cast of R&B Divas: Atlanta season 3, and her main storyline included being afraid to sing on the show, as she felt she wasn't ready to do so, despite the show being called R&B Divas. Season 3 of R&B Divas consisted of eleven episodes starring LaTavia (including the reunion shows). To promote R&B Divas, she appeared on the Wendy Williams Show in May 2014. In 2015, Roberson announced she had gotten into the hair business with Luxury Hair Direct which specializes in hair extensions. She also became involved with the charity 'Saving Our Daughters'.</p><p>In 2010, Roberson revealed that she had suffered with an alcohol problem after Destiny's Child. This led to being arrested with a DWI; however, Roberson went through counselling and is using her experience to help others going through the same thing. On August 21, 2013, Roberson gave birth to daughter Lyric Richard with producer Don Vito. In June 2016, she suffered the late term pregnancy loss of a baby girl. On September 23, 2019, Roberson's management team announced via Instagram that she had given birth to a boy. Roberson's son, Londyn Richard, is her second child with Don Vito.</p><p>In 2010, LaTavia appeared on The Real Housewives of Atlanta speaking to her then-lawyer Phaedra Parks. During this episode, Roberson talked about how she dealt with alcoholic problems and getting in trouble with the law for a DWI.</p><p>In 2009, LaTavia featured in the song "Swagga Check" by Young Sween on his album The Goodie Room, released by Fleet Street Records; the song was mistakenly named "Holdin on to You" on iTunes.</p><p>In 2008, LaTavia was in a stage play titled Those Jeans. It was described as "a truly well written love story, about a fashion designer and a high fashion photographer, looking for love in all the wrong places". It ran from April 18, 2008 to July 12, 2008.</p><p>In 2007, LaTavia along with other Destiny's Child past members <a href=#>LeToya Luckett</a> and <a href=#>Farrah Franklin</a> appeared in the TV series Boulevard of Broken Dreams telling their side of the story about what happened during their time with Destiny's Child.</p><p>In July 2006, it was confirmed by LaTavia herself, that she was secretly recording her debut album on and off since March 2006. She collaborated with producers such as <a href=#>Scott Storch</a> and hoped to work with Houston rappers Mike Jones and <a href=#>Slim Thug</a> in the future, but was quick to point out it was in no way an attempt to recreate the success of former bandmate <a href=#>LeToya Luckett</a>. Her album would appear sometime in 2009, called 'Black Summer's Night', a mix of hip-hop meets jazz and soul, with help from Swizz Beatz, Polow da Don, and André 3000 of Outkast. Unfortunately, she never managed to complete this album, so it was never released.</p><p>In 2005, LaTavia got invited to replace Kandi in the group Xscape, but passed on the opportunity due to her priority to take care of her family at home in Houston.</p><p>After that, they created a group called Anjel with two other girls, Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin. They recorded a 22-track demo to release their album, Heavenly, with the help of Jagged Edge. Unfortunately, the production company which handled the group fell through and all the girls from Anjel went their separate ways. The label was 581 Entertainment, ran by Jagged Edge, under So So Def while it was still under Columbia. The group never released Heavenly and split up in 2003 before actually recording a full album. The tracks were leaked on the internet.</p><p>Jermaine Dupri's leaving Columbia Records caused problems with 581 Entertainment. Prior to the move, Anjel's project was on track to be released. The members decided to look into individual projects while group business issues were being handled. In 2003, the record company soon folded and the group broke up.</p><p>In 2001, LaTavia and LeToya had achieved two Grammys for their contribution to "Say My Name", after leaving.</p><p>In 2000, Linda Casey, the mother of two members of Jagged Edge, held a talent search in Connecticut. This contest would determine the newest member of the group, Natasha Ramos. Due to personality differences, Ramos left the group. Before leaving, she introduced them to Naty Quinones, who auditioned and was added to the group. In 2001, Anjel attended the Grammys. Later that year, Tiffany Beaudoin was introduced to Anjel by a mutual friend, and joined after an audition. The group made one live appearance in 2001 on Good Day, NY; they talked about the album they were working on and sang part of their song "Missing You".</p><p>In March 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against <a href=#>Mathew Knowles</a> and the group. This began a media battle in which the two sides exchanged barbs in magazine and newspaper interviews. Roberson and Luckett agreed to a settlement that required them to drop the part of their lawsuit that targeted their former group members (though they retained the suit against Mathew Knowles) and required both sides to stop disparaging each other in public. Roberson and Luckett later filed another suit against Destiny's Child. They claimed that the first single, "Survivor", from Destiny's Child's 2001 album of the same name violated their previous settlement due to its lyrics which they believed referenced the ugly split with lyrics such as "thought I couldn't sell without you, sold nine million". In July 2002, Destiny's Child again settled out of court with Roberson and Luckett.</p><p>In 1999, Destiny's Child released their second album The Writing's on the Wall. It became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group and was certified eight-times platinum in the U.S. The album includes four hit singles, "Bills, Bills, Bills", "Bug a Boo", "Say My Name", and "Jumpin', Jumpin'". LaTavia also gained co-writing contribution more on this album than their first. Roberson performed lead on two songs: "Sweet Sixteen" and "Where'd You Go". Additionally LaTavia sang lead on the song "Can't Help Myself" but this song only was released on the albums Houston Edition. In late 1999, in the midst of the success of The Writing's on the Wall, Roberson and <a href=#>LeToya Luckett</a> attempted to bring in a third-party mediator to work with their manager Mathew Knowles; however, the pair soon found themselves on the outs with Knowles. When the "Say My Name" video debuted in February 2000, the pair learned they'd been replaced by Michelle Williams and <a href=#>Farrah Franklin</a>, which led to several lawsuits with the outcome of Roberson and Luckett being entitled to royalty checks from the previous albums they had made with the group.</p><p>When LaTavia was nine years old, she auditioned for a girl group to become a rapper and dancer, and was one of the many girls who got through. She met Beyoncé Knowles on the same day of the audition for the group and became best friends, singing and dancing with other local girls in which LaTavia and Beyoncé made a video for the song "One Time". She then met Kelly Rowland in elementary school after hearing her sing she told her to try out for the group which she did. Initially LaTavia was a rapper and dancer at the time and did not sing; subsequently she had vocal lessons and, after singing at local events, LaTavia got her break when she entered the singing competition TV show Star Search with Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Tamar Davis and LaTavia's cousins Nikki and Nina Taylor. The group, then named Girl's Tyme were heartbroken after losing the competition to Skeleton Crew. Beyonce's father <a href=#>Mathew Knowles</a> began to manage the group, and he changed the line-up as the group was then reduced to a quartet, with best-friend Beyoncé, Rowland, and Beyoncé's elementary school friend <a href=#>LeToya Luckett</a>. The group underwent several name changes: The Dolls, Something Fresh, and Cliché. They were shortly signed to Elektra Records. However the group were dropped by the label. After plenty of training done by the manager to become prepared and ready for the music industry, they were signed by Columbia Records in 1997 by the name of Destiny's Child with Knowles as lead vocalist, Rowland as second-lead vocalist, and Roberson and Luckett as background vocalists. Roberson was the alto, adding the low notes, and Luckett was the soprano, adding the high notes to the group's harmony. Roberson was designated as the group's spokesperson. In 1998, Destiny's Child released their self-titled debut album Destiny's Child. The singles were "No, No, No" featuring Wyclef Jean and "With Me". Roberson can be heard rapping in the song "Illusions". Later in 1998, their song "Get on the Bus" featuring Timbaland (which was released as a single in Europe) was featured on the Why Do Fools Fall in Love soundtrack. The song was the lead single for their second album. Destiny's Child toured as an opening act on TLC's FanMail Tour and Christina Aguilera's debut tour.</p><p>LaTavia Marie Roberson (born November 1, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress.
