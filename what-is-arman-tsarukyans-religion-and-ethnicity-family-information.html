<time>22 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>The UFC lightweight sensation Arman Tsarukyan is a formidable opponent who has gained a lot of attention for his skill as a challenger.</strong></p><p>Even though he dominates the mixed martial arts scene, a lot of people are curious about the personal life of this well-known Russian-Armenian athlete. Tsarukyan’s public stance on faith and religion has remained secret, leading to ongoing discussions over his religious beliefs. The athlete’s enigmatic persona is enhanced by the mystery surrounding his religious convictions.</p><p>Born on August 11, 1996, Arman Tsarukyan is a professional mixed martial artist of Armenian and Russian descent. Tsarukyan competes as a lightweight fighter in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). On September 25, 2015, Arman defeated Shamil Olokhanov to make his MMA debut.</p><p>He lost against Alexander Belikh in the first game, but he bounced back to win 12 straight games, including one revenge match. After that, Tsarukyan joined the UFC, where he made his debut on April 20, 2019, at UFC Fight Night: Overeem vs. Oleinik, against Islam Makhachev. He lost, but he still got the Fight of the Night bonus.</p><p>Tsarukyan won over Joel Varez and Christos Giagos, extending his impressive achievements and winning him Performance of the Night. Tsarukyan defeated all three of his opponents to win the expert middleweight division at NAGA Los Angeles on October 1, 2023. His versatility and perseverance suggest a prosperous future in mixed martial arts.</p><h2><span id=Is_Arman_Tsarukyan_a_Christian_or_a_Muslim_Religion_and_Parents>Is Arman Tsarukyan a Christian or a Muslim? Religion and Parents</span></h2><p>Because Arman Tsarukyan is rarely seen talking about his views, many are worried about his religion and whether he is a Muslim. In a small, primarily Christian hamlet in Georgia, Tsarukyan was born into an Armenian family. Arman Tsarukyan is not a Muslim; rather, he is an Orthodox Christian. Nairi Tsarukyan and Anahit Hakobyan were the parents of Tsarukyan. His mother, Anahit Hakobyan, is a businesswoman in the construction industry, while his father, Nairi, is a businessman.</p><p>He grew up surrounded by two siblings: a younger sister and an older brother. Arman’s family moved to Russia when he was three years old in quest of better opportunities. Tysarukyan was born in Akhalkalaki, Georgia, however, he is of Armenian and Russian nationality.</p><h2><span id=Religion_and_Parents_Kids_and_Spouses>Religion and Parents Kids and Spouses</span></h2><p>Tsarukyan has a spouse. About four years ago, in April of this year, he was married. His wife’s name is Melina. There are two kids that Arman and his spouse have together. According to reports, the couple’s younger daughter was born in 2022, while their older daughter was born in 2020.</p><p>Tsarukyan doesn’t seem to publish pictures on social media and appears to have a more quiet existence. It is therefore difficult to get information on his wife or kids. One may assume that Tsarukyan’s cultural and familial origins had an impact on his decision to keep his affairs hidden with his wife and family. Like Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev, many Russian fighters want to keep their private lives private.</p><h2><span id=Arman_Tsarukyan_and_Islam_Makhachev_rematching>Arman Tsarukyan and Islam Makhachev rematching?</span></h2><p>Islam Makhachev and Tsarukyan have a past, with Makhachev winning by a unanimous vote in April 2019. Tsarukyan recently defeated Beneil Dariush in an incredible 64-second victory. Tsarukyan expressed his wish to face Makhachev again at his press conference, expressing confidence that he could prevail in the opening round. “I’m always thinking the best-case scenario, and I feel like I can knock him out in the first round,” Tsarukyan said in his prediction of the bout.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/jonathan-groff-who-is-out-gay-discusses-a-relationship-gone-wrong/"}{"1":78}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>athlete.</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is The Brother Of Derrick Josi | Parents And Family Details</a></h3>Farmer Derrick Josi works with Wilsonview Dairy in Tillamook, Oregon.
