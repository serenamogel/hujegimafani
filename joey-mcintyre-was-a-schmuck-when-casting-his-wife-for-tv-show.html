Co-starring alongside him is his wife of nearly 14 years, Barrett, and their three kids: Griffin, 9, Rhys, 7, and Kira, 5.</p><p><a href=#>Before he hits the road next month</a> with NKOTB for a 48-date tour with Boyz II Men and Paula Abdul, 44-year-old McIntyre spoke to The Post about learning to embrace his nostalgic fame and the balancing act of casting your family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/joey4a.jpg><h3>Why cast your own wife in the series?</h3><p>I wanted to do a scripted show, but [with] the reality aspect of today’s entertainment world, I thought that was a good mix. I went back and forth … which is weird, because first of all you’re asking your wife to really help you out and then you’re like, “Well, I’m not so sure.” I was a schmuck there for a while. I was just trying to … keep my producer hat on and make sure I was doing what was right for the show. She was great. The more we went along with the series I just realized how good she is.</p><h3>What was your kids’ reaction to being on TV?</h3><p>They loved it. My daughter seems like a natural in that she’s got a dry sense of humor. My youngest son, Rhys, was a director’s dream because he would hit his mark every time, it was amazing. And then my oldest son, he’s a little bit more of a showman. Everybody had their [screen time], but my wife of course was like, “It better be even.”</p><h3>Do you feel, like your character, that people won’t take you seriously as an actor because of your boy-band past?</h3><p>Not really; I had to get over it to play it because if this was still a problem I don’t think I would be able to freely put my ego aside and … be the butt of the joke. There have been times in my career when I’ve felt that way … [But] over the last few years I’ve focused on my acting career a little bit more and I’ve had great opportunities, so I was in a good place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/joey_nkotb1a.jpg><h3>What’s it like to still be performing with New Kids 30 years after you first joined?</h3><p>Crazy. We took a lot of time off, but we’ve been together this time now longer than the first time. It’s a ton of fun. We take it seriously but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We know how lucky we are to be playing arenas and doing what we love to do. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.</p><h3>What’s the fan reaction these days when you walk down the street?</h3><p>It’s not 1990. But it seems like every time I need a fan to be somewhere, they are — whether it’s getting a nice table in a restaurant or getting me on a plane somehow. My life is at a good place right now where I still get to do what I want to do but it’s not too crazy, famewise.</p><h3>What’s your all-time-favorite NKOTB song?</h3><p>I’m partial to “Please Don’t Go Girl” because I get to sing that. I still enjoy singing it and it still has a lot of meaning for me.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21mamtfn7ymxYymmqKmpK6%2FpnnWmqpmmV2osKm51JyiZq%2BYmrtur8Csq6Kml2K1qr%2BMsKCfnV2bvLN5069krKCfrHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoey-mcintyre-was-a-schmuck-when-casting-his-wife-for-tv-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./mark-harmons-and-their-hollywood-careers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./mark-harmons-and-their-hollywood-careers.html>Mark Harmons children and their Hollywood careers</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aaron-krause-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Aaron Krause Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aaron-krause-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
